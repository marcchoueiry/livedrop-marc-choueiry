        "Once registered, buyers can immediately browse products, add items to the cart, and explore features like wishlists or saved items. Buyers have access to order tracking, reviews, and applying promo codes during checkout. Seller accounts, on the other hand, allow users to manage inventory, add products with descriptions and images, track sales, handle returns, and configure shipping options. Business verification is required for sellers, which may include submitting a company name, tax ID, and contact details.\n",

        "For account management, users can edit personal and account information. Changing the password requires entering the old password, then typing the new one twice. If the old password is correct and the new ones match, the password is updated, and a confirmation message “Password changed successfully” is shown. Personal info like name and date of birth can only be edited twice, and after that, users must wait one month before making further changes.\n",
