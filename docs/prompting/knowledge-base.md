## Document 1: Shoplite User Registration Process

To create a Shoplite account, users visit the registration page and provide their email address, password, and basic profile information. Email verification is required within 24 hours of registration. Users can choose between buyer accounts (free) or seller accounts (requires business verification).  

Once registered, buyers can immediately browse products, add items to the cart, and explore features like wishlists or saved items. Buyers have access to order tracking, reviews, and applying promo codes during checkout. Seller accounts, on the other hand, allow users to manage inventory, add products with descriptions and images, track sales, handle returns, and configure shipping options. Business verification is required for sellers, which may include submitting a company name, tax ID, and contact details.  

For account management, users can edit personal and account information. Changing the password requires entering the old password, then typing the new one twice. If the old password is correct and the new ones match, the password is updated, and a confirmation message “Password changed successfully” is shown. Personal info like name and date of birth can only be edited twice, and after that, users must wait one month before making further changes.  

Seller accounts have additional features. They can update contact info such as email, phone, and address anytime. They also need to complete business information to gain trust from buyers and enable smooth order processing. The dashboard allows sellers to track stock, view pending orders, and manage promotions or discounts.  

Shoplite keeps everything synced across devices. Users can log in from a phone, tablet, or computer, and see their cart, orders, or inventory without losing data. Notifications keep users informed about important updates, like account changes or verification status.  

Overall, the registration process is designed to be simple, secure, and functional. It provides all the necessary features depending on whether the user is a buyer or a seller, while keeping rules clear for passwords, personal info edits, and business verification.

## Document 2: Shoplite Shopping Cart Features

The Shoplite shopping cart allows users to add multiple items from different sellers, apply promotional codes, and save items for later purchase. Cart contents are preserved for logged-in users across sessions, so users can log in from another device and still find everything they added.  

Users can update quantities of items, remove products they no longer want, or move them to a “save for later” list if they’re not ready to buy immediately. For example, if someone adds a phone and a case, they might purchase the phone now but save the case for later. The cart automatically splits items by seller at checkout since each seller fulfills their own orders. Users can also choose different shipping options per seller if available.  

Promotional codes can be applied either in the cart or during checkout. If a code is invalid, expired, or doesn’t meet minimum requirements, the system notifies the user. Prices automatically update if a product changes price while in the cart, and out-of-stock items are flagged with alerts so users don’t try to purchase unavailable items.  

The cart shows a summary with subtotal, taxes, shipping, discounts, and the total amount, making it clear how much the user will pay. Shoplite also suggests related or complementary products under the cart, like accessories for electronics or matching items for clothing, giving users a chance to find what they might need.  

Cross-device syncing ensures that items added on a phone appear on a computer or tablet. Users also get notifications if a saved item is running low in stock or if a promotion is ending soon. Sellers cannot change what’s in the buyer’s cart, but the system automatically updates availability and pricing if needed.  

Overall, the Shoplite shopping cart is designed to be flexible, informative, and convenient, giving users full control over what they want to buy while making sure everything stays accurate and up to date across devices and sessions.

## Document 3: Shoplite Checkout and Payment Flow

When a user finishes adding items to the cart, they go to the checkout page to finalize the order. First, they confirm the shipping address and select a delivery method. Users can save multiple addresses in their profile and pick the one they want for each order. Then they choose a payment option, like credit or debit card, PayPal, cash on delivery if the seller allows it, or Shoplite Wallet credits. The system applies any discounts or promotional codes, and shows the final total before confirming the payment.  

If the payment succeeds, the order is confirmed and the seller is notified to prepare the items. If the payment fails, the user can try again, choose a different method, or contact support. For cash on delivery, the order is marked pending until the delivery is completed. Users are also shown an estimated delivery date based on the shipping option they selected.  

The checkout page is connected to the cart, so if any item went out of stock while the user was still shopping, the system will alert them before placing the order. Users can also see a summary including subtotal, shipping, taxes, discounts, and total. If there are errors, like an invalid promo code or insufficient wallet balance, the system notifies the user with clear messages. Additionally, Shoplite suggests add-ons or complementary items during checkout, like a phone case or charger if a phone is being purchased.  

Finally, Shoplite keeps a copy of the invoice in the user’s account, so they can view it anytime. Users can also choose gift wrapping or special instructions if the seller offers it. The checkout process is designed to be simple but flexible, letting users review and change anything before confirming the payment.

## Document 4: Shoplite Order Tracking and Delivery

After an order is placed, the user receives an order ID and can track the status from their account. The order status updates automatically, showing stages like “Processing,” “Shipped,” “Out for Delivery,” and “Delivered.” Sellers update the status from their dashboard, and Shoplite syncs with delivery partners to provide live tracking. Users get notifications by email or in the app whenever the status changes.  

Shoplite supports multiple shipping addresses, so users can send items to different locations and track each order separately. If a shipment is delayed, the system sends an alert with an explanation and the new estimated delivery date. For deliveries, some items may require a signature or PIN to confirm receipt. If a user is unavailable, the delivery partner may attempt redelivery or leave the item at a secure pickup location.  

Partial shipments are supported too. For example, if a user orders multiple products from the same seller, some items may be shipped immediately while others take longer. Users can see which items are included in each shipment. Shoplite also allows users to contact support from the tracking page if there is a problem, like a missing package or damaged product.  

Notifications are designed to keep users informed at every step. Users can opt in for push notifications on mobile or SMS alerts. The system also records delivery history in the account so users can check past orders. Shoplite tries to make tracking simple but reliable, giving users control and visibility until their order reaches them.

## Document 5: Shoplite Return and Refund Policies

Shoplite allows users to request a return within 14 days from the delivery date. The item must be unused, undamaged, and in its original packaging. To start a return, users go to “My Orders,” select the item, and choose “Request Return.” The seller receives the request and must approve it. Once approved, a return label is issued so the user can send the item back.  

After the item is returned and inspected, the refund is processed. Users can get their money back through the original payment method or Shoplite Wallet credits. Refund times vary: wallet refunds are usually instant, while card refunds can take 5–7 business days. Some products, like perishable goods, digital downloads, or personalized items, are not eligible for returns.  

If a return is rejected, for example because the item is damaged or used, it is sent back to the user. Shoplite may provide step-by-step instructions to make the process easier, including how to package the item, print the label, and schedule a pickup. Users are also notified at each step: when the return is approved, when the item is received, and when the refund is issued.  

Sellers can have additional return rules, like specifying certain courier partners. Users should check the seller’s policy alongside Shoplite’s general rules. Overall, the system is designed to protect buyers while giving sellers clear steps to handle returns efficiently.

## Document 6: Shoplite Product Reviews and Ratings

After receiving their order, buyers on Shoplite can leave a review and rating for the product. Ratings range from 1 to 5 stars, and buyers can also write comments describing their experience and upload photos of the product. Verified Purchase badges ensure that only actual buyers can leave reviews, which helps other users trust the feedback.

Reviews are important for both buyers and sellers. Buyers can filter reviews by rating, date, or whether images are included. Sellers can respond to reviews, thanking buyers or clarifying issues. Negative reviews remain visible to maintain transparency, but spam or abusive comments can be reported and removed after Shoplite review.

Each review contributes to the product’s overall rating, which is displayed prominently on the product page. High-rated products gain more visibility in search results, encouraging more sales, while consistently low ratings can alert sellers to potential quality issues. Shoplite also analyzes reviews to detect patterns like frequent complaints about a product defect or shipping delays, helping the platform improve the overall experience.

Buyers can edit their reviews within a limited time frame, for example to add more details or correct mistakes. Shoplite stores review history, so users can see past feedback and maintain accountability. Images in reviews give other buyers a realistic view of the product’s condition. Sellers often use reviews to improve products, adjust descriptions, or fix recurring issues.

## Document 8: Shoplite Inventory Management for Sellers

Managing inventory is a core responsibility for sellers on Shoplite, and the platform provides several tools to make it easier. Each product listing requires details such as name, description, category, price, and available stock. Sellers can also manage variations like size, color, or style, with each variation having its own stock count. Keeping inventory accurate is essential to avoid overselling, prevent cancellations, and maintain buyer trust.

When an order is placed, Shoplite automatically updates the stock, and sellers receive low-stock alerts when quantities reach a predefined threshold. This allows them to restock items before they sell out. If a buyer has an item in their cart and it goes out of stock before checkout, the system immediately notifies them, preventing disappointment or abandoned orders.

Shoplite supports inventory management across multiple locations or warehouses, which is useful for sellers handling large volumes. Bulk upload options make it simple to add hundreds of products at once. Analytics tools provide insights on top-selling products, helping sellers decide which items to prioritize for restocking or promotion. Pre-orders and backorders are supported, enabling sellers to accept orders even if stock is temporarily unavailable.

Sellers can also adjust prices and stock levels at any time, which is particularly useful for seasonal products, flash sales, or limited editions. Notifications alert sellers to items that require attention, such as perishable goods nearing expiration. By maintaining accurate and organized inventory, sellers ensure that buyers have a smooth experience, avoid stock-related issues, and build a strong reputation on Shoplite. Overall, the inventory management system combines automation, analytics, and flexibility to help sellers operate efficiently and grow their business.

## Document 9: Shoplite Commission and Fee Structure

Shoplite charges sellers a commission for each completed sale, which is typically a percentage of the product price. The exact percentage varies by product category and can range from 5% to 15%. Additional fees may apply for optional services like promoted listings, premium account features, or certain payment methods. Sellers can view all commissions and fees in their dashboard, providing transparency and helping them understand their net earnings.

Refunds, returns, and chargebacks automatically deduct the corresponding amounts from the seller’s balance. Shoplite provides detailed transaction reports for every sale, showing commissions, deductions, and expected payouts. Payouts are usually processed weekly, either to the seller’s linked bank account or Shoplite Wallet, ensuring sellers can manage their cash flow efficiently.

Understanding the fee structure is essential for pricing products correctly. Sellers need to account for commissions and any additional charges when setting prices to maintain profitability. Transparent reporting helps sellers plan promotions, restock inventory, and evaluate their business performance. By clearly showing how fees are calculated and applied, Shoplite fosters trust between the platform and sellers. This transparency also helps prevent disputes and encourages sellers to focus on growing their sales rather than worrying about hidden costs.

Shoplite provides a RESTful API that allows developers to integrate Shoplite functionality into external applications, dashboards, or analytics platforms. The API supports key operations such as searching for products, creating and updating orders, managing user accounts, and modifying inventory. Developers need an API key for authentication, and endpoints are subject to rate limits to prevent abuse.
