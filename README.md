**Explanation:**

In order to make the system fulfill the requirements, I started by managing the database tables, I made 7 tables each having primary keys (PK) and secondary keys and interacting with each others through foreign keys (FK), which will make the system implementation more flexible and less costly. I designed the APIs for the necessary operations, like the follow service having a post API for following creators, and get APIs for being able to check his own followings, a creator followers, weither some user follow some creator or not.
the final diagram shows how the user through a web or mobile app interact which is the client, interact with the the server by sending requests to use services through the API gateway, the server processes the request, applies the business logic, and update or fetches data from the database. The server sends back a response to the client, which is then displayed in the app.
